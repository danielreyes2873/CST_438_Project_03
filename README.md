# CST_438_Project_03: Quiz Time
This Android app allows users to create custom quizzes to make studying easier. Quizzes, once made, can be viewed by anyone but only edited by the user who made it. The app will make use of a custom made REST API built with Django's Rest Framework and a persistence layer built with SQLite in Android Room. It will be containerized with Docker and the API will be deployed on heroku. The app will feature an aesthetically pleasing and easy to use interface and a robust back end.
